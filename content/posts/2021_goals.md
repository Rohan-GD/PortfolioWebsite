- **Start writing a blog**

I want to start writing about stuff that I am interested in or the stuff that I am most associated with, like weird stories, book reviews, technical reviews and also life experiences. Also some project tutorials.

- **Improve vocabulary (10 new words a day)**

After passing out of school one year ago , I lost touch with my previously hard earned vocabulary and English proficiency( I wish..) , I want to improve and use new words daily.

- **Read 100 books (non-academic)**

It's been two years since I have actively read any non-academic book (NCERT go brrr.....) , so I want to expand my knowledge to have a wider perspective on my life and surroundings.

- **Make a project each month (not really working ðŸ˜¥)**

As James Clear states in his book Atomic Habits about *motion* and *action*, I am still in the *motion* phase, which is thinking about and planning about doing more projects whereas this goal makes me transition into the *action* phase (where I actually do some work) over a period of time.

- **Improve French (and Japanese ^_^ )**

After a very dramatic event that occurred 2 years ago at the Allianz FranÃ§ais, tvm, I lost touch with my really hard earned French proficiency, no lie here. So I want to kickstart that again along with learning Japanese so that one day I can watch anime without any subtitles âœ¨

- **Bodybuilding (haha too lazy, haven't started)**

Due to the lockdown, I haven't exercised in 9 months so I want to get my body back in shape so that I can handle the upcoming tough academic year well.

- **Get into an execom of any tech club**

I believe , having a role of responsibility in a technical club would help me to improve my decision making skills, event organizing skill as well as my technical skills. Also I want to meet new people. Thanks to my hard work , improving my portfolio by volunteering in many stuff in my first year in college, I got into IEEE SB CET, yay!! ðŸ¥³

- **Make use of each and every opportunity**

The reason I put this here is because I missed out on a lot of good opportunities to do some useful work and make some good friends and I really don't want a repeat of that this year as I am striving to be more bold.

- **Be more social( on twitter mostly)**

I don't actually like that much socializing on social media apps, which is why I have totally stopped IG stories and I use it only to maintain my friends in school. I want to use twitter to share my work in tech, progress and such. This is still in the motion phase

- **Develop a passion in tech, research in tech, and teaching tech.**

This is to remind myself to not spend too much time watching cats on instagram or husky videos  rather learn new stuff so that I can start building some awesome stuff.
