## Heyyy! ,I'm Rohan

 I'm an electrical engineer and a total weeb who enjoys binge watching anime in my free time and also making some hardware projects. Most of my days are spent watching anime, researching about some cool hardware projects in hackster.io, planning my future projects and thinking about ways to make my life more productive with various productivity tactics. This year I am planning to spend some time working on my blog to improve my writing skills so that I can finally be a *writer*.

 As someone who recently got introduced to working with technology(developing,programming,etc;), I started to **see** clearly , the plethora of opportunities I have as an engineering student to use technology to serve the society and I decided to commit my entire life to learning new things and helping others.

 One of my recently found fascinations is robotics and I am working on a very cool robotics project with my college mates. I am now a RAS chapter lead in my college and I'm working on organising various fun events and workshops in my college. 
 Now I am a sophomore at College of Engineering Trivandrum , studying electrical and electronics engineering and in my second year there, I am working on starting some research work on my core study areas and building a solid understanding on my course.
  If you want to talk me about anime, hardware projects or football(*I'm an Arsenal fan btw*), you can reach me here :
